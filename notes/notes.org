* Notes

- `default_nettype None
   - enforce a "strict mode" i.e. avoid implicit declaration of variables and ports (usually as wires) and used at the top of the code.
   - /backtick/ signifies a "compiler directive" and persistent across a "compilation unit"
   - "Net" represents a physical connection between components and usually it doesn't store value and rather carries the value e.g. wires

- `timescale <unit>/<precision>
  - 1ns/1ps is commonly used with FPGA and ASIC RTL because, for a balance in accuracy & simulation speed

- reg, always@ and non-blocking assignments
